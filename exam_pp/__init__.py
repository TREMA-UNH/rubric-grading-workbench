# my_package/__init__.py

# This file can be empty or may contain package-level initialization code.
# When this file is present in a directory, Python treats the directory as a package.
# You might include package-level imports or define variables/functions that need to
# be available when the package is imported.

# For example, if you want to expose certain names from your modules when the package
# is imported, you can use the following:

# from .my_module import my_function, MyClass, main

# __all__ = ['my_function', 'MyClass', 'main']
