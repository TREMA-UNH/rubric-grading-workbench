Another type of stem cell, called an embryonic (em-bre-ON-ik) stem cell, can develop into any type of cell in the body. These cells aren't found in bone marrow.
3038512	The goal of a bone marrow transplant is to cure many diseases and types of cancer. When the doses of chemotherapy or radiation needed to cure a cancer are so high that a person's bone marrow stem cells will be permanently damaged or destroyed by the treatment, a bone marrow transplant may be needed. The donor is the patient himself or herself. 2  Stem cells are taken from the patient either by bone marrow harvest or apheresis (a process of collecting peripheral blood stem cells), frozen, and then given back to the patient after intensive treatment. 3  Often the term rescue is used instead of transplant.

8527723	The replacement marrow may be the patient's own marrow or it may come from another person. If the marrow comes from the patient. it is called an autologous bone marrow transplant. If the marrow is from an identical twin, it is termed a syngeneic transplant. And if the marrow is from a donor who is not an identical twin, the procedure is an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Most bone marrow transplants today are allogeneic. Bone marrow transplant is abbreviated BMT.

In the Etruscan world, events occurred because they must have a meaning, though meaning was discovered through the kind of reasoning we would find puzzling. E.g., clouds collide in order to release lightning The Etruscans looked upward to find this meaning: life was governed by gods in the skies. They obsessed over clouds, lightning, thunder, the position of the stars, and birds flying over. Lasa, (probably), female divinity.

2631821	The Etruscans were organized into a loose confederation of city-states to the north of Rome. Around 650 B.C.E., they took control of the site of Rome, with its defensible hills and location on a ford of the Tiber River. They did a number of things to transform this crude collection of shepherds' huts into a true city. The Etruscans introduced rectangular urban planning.

2640471	Roman Government. Ancient Rome experienced three different types of government: Monarchy; Republic; Empire; While the myth of Rome’s origins involve Romulus killing his twin brother Remus to rule Rome and name it after himself, we know that the area was ruled by the Etruscans in the seventh century B.C. This means that Rome was under the power of a monarchy in its earliest period, which is a system of government that has one ruler. Evidence points to seven different kings ruling Rome at this time. However, sometime around 509 B.C., the citizens of Rome gained control from the Etruscans and established the Roman Republic.

The Romans established a form of government — a republic — that was copied by countries for centuries In fact, the government of the United States is based partly on Rome's model. The ladder to political power in the Roman Senate was different for the wealthy patricians than for the lower-class plebeians. It all began when the Romans overthrew their Etruscan conquerors in 509 B.C.E. Centered north of Rome, the Etruscans had ruled over the Romans for hundreds of years. Once free, the Romans established a republic, a government in which citizens elected representatives to rule on their behalf.

Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.

1831357	If you normally incubate chicken eggs at 100* and 50% humidity, then do quail the same way. The only ones I've found that need it a little different are button quail because they dry out too easily. They should take 18 days to hatch but can hatch anywhere from 15-21 days. Stop turning day 14 to be safe, though I've had them hatch in the turners with little problems. Coturnix eggs are pretty easy, you could probably set them in a bowl out in your yard and they'd hatch.

This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of l … ight, they will approx. lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year.
5241320	Okay so about 4 days ago my Button started laying eggs. I have a total of 6. I thought okay no problem when she didn't lay any for a day. then laid 2 today to make up for the day she missed. How many will she lay?hey can lay an egg a day until 2 years (then an egg every other day)...then there are those that are 5 years that lay 1 a week and get older and retire Personal experience.

5241326	Breeding Quail. Always keep quails in pairs or at least one male to three hens to prevent fighting. Quails nest on the ground and lay six to twelve eggs. They sit on them for thirteen days and if the amount of eggs is too large for the hen, the cock will join her on the nest.Chicks are tiny, but are able to feed themselves straight away.hey are smaller and flightier than Japanese quail. They produce smaller eggs too. Their lifespan is three to five years. Hens have a slightly shorter lifespan as it depends on how many eggs she has laid in her lifetime and if the required nutrients such as calcium were readily available.

6514779	Incubation for button quail takes roughly 16 days, although we have had reports of a little slower hatch of up to 18 days. We suspect that is due to the varied temperatures and movement during transportation, or perhaps due to the variance in incubator temperatures, humidity, and elevation changes.

6514781	A good hatch depends on how well you know your incubator. For the first 14 days the button quail eggs should be turned (better described as being rotated from one side to the other) at least twice a day. Three or four times a day is better. If you have an automatic turner in your incubator, it will handle that for you.

6534081	They are capable of laying around 230 eggs (some have laid up to 300) if kept in the right conditions, given some light during the shorter days and adequate protection from the cold over the winter. Quail start to lay eggs at just 8-12 weeks (assuming there is enough daylight) so they are productive very quickly compared to chickens. Four quail eggs are roughly the same as a chicken egg, although they have a slightly higher quantity of yolk to white in an egg.

6286925	DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Carvedilol is used for treating high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. It is related to labetalol (Normodyne, Trandate). Carvedilol blocks receptors of the adrenergic nervous system, the system of nerves in which adrenalin (epinephrine) is active.arvedilol also blocks adrenergic receptors on arteries and causes the arteries to relax and the blood pressure to fall. The drop in blood pressure further reduces the work of the heart since it is easier to pump blood against a lower pressure. The FDA first approved carvedilol in 1995.

3839636	Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Guide. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. TSH is produced when the hypothalamus releases a substance called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH then triggers the pituitary gland to release TSH.TSH causes the thyroid gland to make two hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 and T4 help control your body's metabolism. Find the cause of an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). 2  TSH levels can help determine whether hypothyroidism is due to a damaged thyroid gland or some other cause (such as a problem with the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus).

6835512	The term “goiter” simply refers to the abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is important to know that the presence of a goiter does not necessarily mean that the thyroid gland is malfunctioning.A goiter can occur in a gland that is producing too much hormone (hyperthyroidism), too little hormone (hypothyroidism), or the correct amount of hormone (euthyroidism).A goiter indicates there is a condition present which is causing the thyroid to grow abnormally.his signal is called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). As the name implies, this hormone stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone and to grow in size. This abnormal growth in size produces what is termed a “goiter.” Thus, iodine deficiency is one cause of goiter development.

8097987	Another type, called toxic nodular goiter, results when one or more nodules, or adenomas, develop in the thyroid and trigger excess production of thyroid hormone. In short, a goiter is any enlargement of the thyroid gland. A goiter may be a temporary problem that will remedy itself over time without medical intervention, or a symptom of another, possibly severe, thyroid condition that requires medical attention. What Causes a Goiter? Goiters can occur when the thyroid gland produces either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or not enough (hypothyroidism). Much more rarely, the problem may arise when the pituitary gland stimulates thyroid growth to boost production of the hormone.

8233395	Rarely, the condition is caused by the pituitary gland making too much thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Certain types of thyroid inflammation (thyroiditis) can cause short-term hyperthyroidism. This can occur after childbirth or after viral infections, for example. In very rare situations, excess thyroid hormone can come from a source outside the thyroid.

8471417	Tests to evaluate thyroid function include the following: TSH TESTS. The best way to initially test thyroid function is to measure the TSH level in a blood sample. A high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is failing because of a problem that is directly affecting the thyroid (primary hypothyroidism). The opposite situation, in which the TSH level is low, usually indicates that the person has an overactive thyroid that is producing too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).

8628509	In spite of this the thyroid gland continues to grow and make thyroid hormone. Therefore, Graves’ disease produces a goiter and hyperthyroidism. Multinodular goiters are another common cause of goiters. Individuals with this disorder have one or more nodules within the gland which cause thyroid enlargement. This is often detected as a nodular feeling gland on physical exam. Patients can present with a single large nodule or with multiple smaller nodules in the gland when first detected (see Thyroid Nodule brochure). Thus, in early stages of a multinodular goiter with many small nodules, the overall size of the thyroid may not be enlarged yet. Unlike the other goiters discussed, the cause of this type of goiter is not well understood. In addition to the common causes of goiter, there are many other less common causes.

8659174	Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Tests of blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) may be used to check the overall activity of your thyroid gland. Levels of TSH, which is made by the pituitary gland, may be high if the thyroid is not making enough hormones. This information can be used to help choose which imaging tests (such as ultrasound or radioiodine scans) to use to look at a thyroid nodule. The TSH level is usually normal in thyroid cancer.

894100	Benign thyroid enlargement and nodules. Changes in the thyroid gland’s size and shape can often be felt or even seen by patients or by their doctor. The medical term for an abnormally large thyroid gland is goiter. Some goiters are diffuse, meaning that the whole gland is large. Other goiters are nodular, meaning that the gland is large and has one or more nodules (bumps) in it. There are many reasons the thyroid gland might be larger than usual, and most of the time it is not cancer.

8626149	In the State of Alabama, the three most common types of deeds used to convey real property are: 1) general warranty deed. 2) statutory warranty deed. 3) quitclaim deed. The general warranty deed gives the purchaser the most complete warranty of title a seller can provide. A statutory warranty deed provides a more narrow warranty to the purchaser. A statutory warranty deed in effect warrants only that the title to the real property has not been affected while the seller owned the real property. A quitclaim deed passes only the interest in the real property owned by the seller. A quitclaim deed does not offer the purchaser any warranty of title.

7040017	Every hip implant has a distinct set of benefits and risks. The key design features of each implant including size, material and dimensions make each system unique. In addition, the same hip implant system will have different outcomes in different patients. It is also important to recognize that hip implants may need to be replaced eventually. Factors that influence the longevity of the device include the patient’s age, sex, weight, diagnosis, activity level, conditions of the surgery, and the type of implant chosen. In the United States, there are currently five types of total hip replacement devices available with different bearing surfaces. These are: Metal-on-Polyethylene: The ball is made of metal and the socket is made of plastic (polyethylene) or has a plastic lining.

726822	Titanium and titanium alloys are used in airplanes, missiles and rockets where strength, low weight and resistance to high temperatures are important. Since titanium does not react within the human body, it is used to create artificial hips, pins for setting bones and for other biological implants. Unfortunately, the high cost of titanium has limited its widespread use. Titanium oxide (TiO 2) is used as a pigment to create white paint and accounts for the largest use of the element. Pure titanium oxide is relatively clear and is used to create titania, an artificial gemstone.

3057739	They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. The bronchioles divide further into smaller terminal bronchioles which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory bronchioles which mark the beginning of the respiratory region. pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.

These bronchioles directly penetrate the alveoli, the bud-like sacs filled with capillaries where oxygen and carbon dioxide enter and leave the bloodstream. This respiratory airway is known as a terminal bronchiole because it is the final pathway of the conducting zone.
7798480	This bronchiole gets subdivided into respiratory bronchioles which comprise of only a few alveoli. Simple cuboidal epithelium, comprising of Clara cells, line the Terminal bronchioles.

7970846	One commonality between skeletal and cardiac muscle is the presence of striations due to the arrangement of actin and myosin into regular myofibrils. The presence of myofibrils and many mitochondria in cardiac muscle cells provides them with great strength and endurance to pump blood throughout an entire lifetime. Visceral muscle cells are found in the organs, blood vessels, and bronchioles of the body to move substances throughout the body.

8772516	The epithelium of the terminal bronchioles is composed of three types of cells-ciliated cells, nonciliated cells and a few basal cells.The epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations.The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. The second consists of nonciliated cuboidal cells. The third is most similar to the alveolar epithelial lining.These are nonciliated cells, cuboidal type II cells, and squamous type I cells.he epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations.

8772517	A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.
8772518	A: Hyaline Cartilage on the periphery is part of the cartilagenous plates that do not enter into the lung. B: Bronchioles carry air from the bronchi to the terminal bronchioles and are line by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium C: Terminal bronchioles are lined by ciliated simple columnar epithelium.: Terminal Bronchioles open up into alveoli allowing the air to pass directly into the alveolar spaces and diffuse across the simple squamous epitheliums of the alveoli and capillaries C: Alveolus is lined by a thin layer of simple squamous to facilitate diffusion of O2 and CO2. A: Ciliated somple columnar epithelium.

8772519	The epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.he trachea branches to give rise to two primary (main) bronchii. These then branch successively to give rise in turn to secondary and tertiary bronchii. These then branch to give rise to several orders of progressively smaller airways called bronchioles, the smallest of which are called terminal bronchioles.

7556561	In genetics, shotgun sequencing, also known as shotgun cloning, is a method used for sequencing long DNA strands. It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun.n shotgun sequencing, DNA is broken up randomly into numerous small segments, which are sequenced using the chain termination method to obtain reads. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing.

816339	Cylinder choke is an unconstricted barrel. The shot pattern spreads quickly. Improved Cylinder choke has a slight constriction. It allows the shot pattern to spread fairly quickly. This is a good choice for quail, rabbits, and other upland game. Modified choke has moderate constriction. The shot stays together longer, making the pattern denser and more useful at longer ranges. This choke is used often for dove hunting and is the preferred choke when using steel shot to hunt for ducks or geese.

8734273	A shotgun shell is a self-contained cartridge typically loaded with multiple metallic  shot , which are small, generally spherical projectiles. Traditionally lead was used, but increasingly steel, tungsten or bismuth shot has replaced lead, due to laws designed to protect the environment.ost shotgun shells contain multiple pellets in order to increase the likelihood of a target being hit.

2375312	Pareto efficiency is achieved. Consider another example: the sale of a used car. The seller may value the car at $10,000, while the buyer is willing to pay $15,000 for it. A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics. In general, an economic allocation problem has several possible Pareto efficient outcomes. In the marketplace, the competitive equilibrium is typically included among them.

2375316	According to Pareto efficiency, however, any allocation of the $100 would be optimal — including the distribution you would likely prefer: keeping all $100 for yourself. Pareto efficiency says that an allocation is efficient if an action makes some individual better off and no individual worse off. The concept was developed by Vilfredo Pareto, an

2884219	Pareto Analysis is a statistical technique in decision making that is used for the selection of a limited number of tasks that produce significant overall effect. It uses the Pareto Principle (also know as the 80/20 rule) the idea that by doing 20% of the work you can generate 80% of the benefit of doing the whole job. Or in terms of quality improvement, a large majority of problems (80%) are produced by a few key causes (20%).

2884220	More generally, the Pareto Principle is the observation (not law) that most things in life are not distributed evenly. It can mean all of the following things: 20% of the input creates 80% of the result. 20% of the workers produce 80% of the result. 20% of the customers create 80% of the revenue.

2884228	What Exactly Is The 80/20 Rule? By the numbers it means that 80 percent of your outcomes come from 20 percent of your inputs. As Pareto demonstrated with his research this “rule” holds true, in a very rough sense, to an 80/20 ratio, however in many cases the ratio can be a lot higher – 99/1 may be closer to reality.

353771	Why does it take so long for the radio waves to travel through space? Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second. The reason that it takes so long for radio messages to travel in space is that space is mind-bogglingly big. The distances to be traveled are so great that even light or radio waves take a while getting there.

785762	Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second. The reason that it takes so long for radio messages to travel in space is that space is mind-bogglingly big. The distances to be traveled are so great that even light or radio waves take a while getting there. It takes around eight minutes for radio waves to travel from the Earth to the Sun, and four years to get from here to the nearest star.

8165492	Originally Answered: Why are radio waves (light) able to travel through buildings, but visible light is not? It all boils down to frequency which is proportional to energy. Wavelength of em wave is = c/f so as frequency changes, and c is constant, wavelength changes and the length of this wave dictates whether it interacts with atoms in a medium or not.

8165495	The reason why visible light can't travel through walls as easily as gamma rays or radio waves is because, to the visible light, there's something 'there' on a similar scale of length (wavelength) and time (frequency) that the gamma rays are too small and fast to interact with and the radio waves are too large and slow to interact with.

8165497	So visible light travels through glass, but not thick wood. Radio waves are long and pass through buildings because of this. Also, gamma rays are short and therefore very high energy which is another way to pass though materials. Interestingly, very long radio waves drag in the earth and water, slowing down and will hug the Earth...

8552235	One is because of what I described above; the wavelength is about the same as ordinary object. Radio waves tend to exhibit diffraction, that is they can bend around objects that are near the same size as their wavelength. So, radio waves can go around objects in general. The other way radio waves interact with objects is by reflection. Radio waves can bounce off objects. Often when radio waves hit an object like a building for example it will do both, refract around the building and reflect off of it as well. Now finally to your question. The main thing that makes radio waves go through an object or reflect off of it is the electromagnetic nature of object itself. Most common building materials like wood, plaster, glass, brick, stones, cement, etc are very poor conductors of electricity. These materials are referred to as dielectric materials.

2067537	Granulation tissue. The extra tissue that grows around the feeding tube is called granulation tissue. It can look dark pink and may bleed easily. Some reasons granulation tissue can form are: the feeding tube moves too much in the stoma; the stoma is wet or covered with a dressing; there is too much pressure on the stoma; there has been trauma to the stoma. How to prevent granulation tissue: 1  Always tape the feeding tube to the skin on your child’s stomach. 2  Make sure your child’s balloon-type G tube fits properly. If you think your child’s balloon- type tube is too loose or too tight, contact your G tube specialist to re-measure the size of the tube.
