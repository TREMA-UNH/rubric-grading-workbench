**Table 1. Results on IR generation methods on DL20 with autograde-qrels**.  Methods are evaluated with Autograder-Qrels using on nuggets and questions of minimum ratings 3,4, and 5 with standard error bars. Results are sorted by question-4. Results are produced with `trec_eval` using `P@20` metric. The current implementation does not support standard error bars.

This result is to demonstrate the applicabiliy of autograder for generated IR methods. Generated methods based on Chat-GPT versions 3.5 and 4, using prompts that ask to generate a Wikipedia article, web page, or direct answer for the query (which is interpreted as a question).

We find that the question-based autograder-qrels is most stable in the rank placement. 

We note that these GPT models were not fine-tuned for this task, and since GPT is used for nugget/question generation there is an unfair advantage , and merely demonstrate that the autograder metrics can be applied, and lend themselves for a comparison between IR methods based on ranking and/or generation.
